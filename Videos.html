            <h3>Genius Deconstructed</h3>
            <p>The Genius Deconstructed series gives you an idea of what goes on in the backend of your favorite hit songs. Deconstructed meets with producers who demonstrate how they made the beat and give production tips as well. Through these videos Ive learned a lot about what makes a good beat and how not to overdue it when it comes to production. One thing Ive learned is that you dont need a lot of elements to make a good beat and how to leave room for an artist to do their thing. In the video below, deconstructed meets with producer YC to show how he made the beat for Pooh Shiesty's Back in Blood.</p>
